#### 4:01 - 6:49 // index rebuild or Reorg
-------------------------------------------------------
    If frag < 30%, we will go for Reorg the indexes
    If Frag > 30%, we will go for Rebuild the indexes

#### 6:50 - 14:17// does rebuild index cause blockings?

#### Online rebuild
----------------
    Yes, only during the final phase of index rebuild.
    Online rebuild index will hold locks(schema-Modification LCK_M) at the last stages (initial stage,intermediate stage & final stage)

    Once the rebuild reaches the last stage, nobody can access the object/table that is being rebuild on index.

#### Offline Rebuild

    Locks (LCK_M) will be held for the majority of the time during rebuild.

- 	Does Reorg index cause blockings?
	Reorg index
        
        No (but will cause blocking for short time with Intent-exclusive table lock)

#### 14:18 - 17:35//  can we stop/kill Jobs of Index Reorg & Index rebuild? What will be the impact?

If there are 30 tables in DB, index rebuild has done 25 tables rebuild, if we stop the job & start the job, will it start from 1st table or start at 26th table?

##### Index Reorg 
Can be interrupted and can start from where it stopped.


##### Index rebuild 
- cannot be interrupted as restart will again start rebuilding from 1st table.

    -- From SQL 2017, there is Resume-online index rebuild feature.
    
    -- Until SQL 2016 versions, all rebuild index operations cannot be interrupted. It is wither full task completion or rollback to the beginning.

#### 17:38 - 24:42// is it possible to track the progress of index Rebuild & Index reorg?

	Rebuild job:
	--------------
    - No Direct method. If we are running a scheduled job, it cannot be tracked for checking progress.
    - But if we are running manually, we CAN track the progress ( by using SET STATISTICS PROFILE ON) using DMV

	Reorg Job:
	--------------
    Yes, DMV sys.dm_exec_request can be used to track the progress.

#### 24:44 - 25:04// how many types of statistics are there?
    Index statistics
    Column statistics

#### 25:05 - 26:12 
Will index rebuild update statistics? 

    Yes, only Index statistics.

Will index Reorg update statistics? 

    No, Reorg will not touch any statistics, we need to manually update statistics after Reorg activity.


#### 26:13 - 36:19 // usually in FULL recovery Mode, every transaction will be logged, so is INDEX REBUILD activity, AG activity it will also log so many records to the transaction file.

What will be your strategy to implement INDEX REBUILD for Very Huge tables?

    Imagine a stand-alone DB of 4 TB size and performing a Rebuild index task, if we change the Recovery from FULL to BULK-LOGGED for index rebuild. 
    
    Once the activity is done, the next log backup size will be huge.


#### 36:21 - 41:39 // if there is 800 GB table size, what should be the strategy of maintenance for indexing, stats etc?

- Ask questions like - is the db under any HA/DR? stand-alone?

- Check the frag %, if 10-30: ReOrg else Rebuild.

- Go for Reorg as we can manually interrupt, can incrementally control the index reorg. (if any blockings we can pause/stop & carry on app workloads, again do Reorg, gradually the frag % will come down.)

- If we get some downtime, we can go for the Rebuild index.

#### 43:51 - 48:17 // how to determine the downtime required for rebuilding indexes for huge database tables?

Best case: 

use Ola Hallengren script. It has a Commandlog table, which logs timings, or if there is no history, we can go with the Reorg index.

#### 48:23 - 45:13 // what is your approach, if there is a performance issue/slowness?

    - Check Wait stats, from there take a lead.

#### 45:15 - 55:26 // what is the difference between Blockings & deadlocks?

#### 56:21 - 1:03:06 // Find the query running for a long time?
- Use sp_whoisactive
- DMV : sys.dm_exec_sql_text(Sql_handle column)
If any wait type status = Runnable (its  CPU)


### Note:
----

1. Below activities can be queried to check the progress of completion status.

Percentage of work completed for the following commands:

- ALTER INDEX REORGANIZE
- AUTO_SHRINK option with ALTER DATABASE
- BACKUP DATABASE
- DBCC CHECKDB
- DBCC CHECKFILEGROUP
- DBCC CHECKTABLE
- DBCC INDEXDEFRAG
- TDE ENCRYPTION
- DBCC SHRINKDATABASE
- DBCC SHRINKFILE
- RECOVERY
- RESTORE DATABASE
- ROLLBACK

2. Speed of Reorg index is inversely proportional to fragmentation. I.e. if the Frag Is higher the speed of Reorg is Slow.

3. Speed of Rebuild index does not consider the Frag % because we are dropping & recreating index, so the speed of the rebuild index depends on the size of index.
