Performance related interview questions
-----------------------------------------------------

Scenario 1:
----------------
Questions: App team is complaining about slowness for a query.

Approach:

- Check what's happening on SQL Server i.e.
    - Is Anti-virus running
    - What activities are running apart from Database activities
    - Check Memory
    - For experienced DBA, dont say “we check Task Manager”, it should be “we check Resource Manager”
- In “resource manager” check the latency parameters like response time, it should be < 20 ms. if its more than that then we need to investigate.
- Then, we will look into sp_whoisactive results 

    OR

- USe DMV like exec_request, process related to find the query texts that are currently running.

- Check blockings (use DMV sys.dm_exec_requests or sp_whoisactive). For exp DBA, try remembering the tsql query (select * from sys.dm_exec_requests cross apply sys.dm_exec_SQL_text (sql_handle) where session_id > 50)

- Check long running queries, using sp_whoisactive
If you find a problematic line of code inside an Stored proc of 1000 lines of code, then to find the exact code that is causing issue can be analysed by using sp_whoisactive & referring to column sql_text (gives currently executing line of code).
- If not sp_whoisactive, then we can use statement_start_offset & statement_end_offset columns using sys.dm_exec_requests DMV

Scenario 2:
-------------
Question: imagine you went out for a break for 1 hr & after coming back, the app team says during the last 1 hr there was slowness. How to approach?

approach: 
- Use Query_store (if SQL 2016 & if its enabled)
- Log the info of sp_whoisactive to a table.
- Schedule a job to capture the blocking details (check vamshi’s script in SQL 2022 Paid)

Will index rebuild update the statistics?.

- Yes, only update index stats
- To check
    - Sp_autostatistics, 
    - dbcc show statistics: 
    - sys.dm_db_stats_properties

What is Full Scan, sampling in statistics?

Full scan : 

- all the records of the table will be scanned & updated.
- Check dbcc show statistics & verify if Rows column & rows sampled, if they are same then Full scan has happened.
- For any slow queries, if you see the difference in Actual no of rows with estimated no of rows, then stats is not Updated. So run Update stats.
    - Update statistics can be done in 
    - FULL SCAN (update statistics <table_name> with fullscan)
    - SAMPLE (update statistics <table_name> with sample Percent/Rows)
