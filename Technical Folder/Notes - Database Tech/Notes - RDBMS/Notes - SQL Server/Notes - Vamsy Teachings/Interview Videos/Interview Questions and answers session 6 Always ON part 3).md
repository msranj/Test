0:00 - 1:15 // Basic details

1:16 - 5:45 // where will you run DBCC CHECKDB? is it on Primary or any secondary replicas?

5:46 - 13:10// what will be the default  isolation level of DB in Always on?

13:13 - 21:50 // how does statistics work on secondary replicas? can we create statistics on secondary replicas?

1:16 - 5:45// where will you run DBCC CHECKDB? Is it on Primary or any secondary replicas?
--------------------------------------------------------------
- it's ok to run on both nodes,we can run on any of the server.
- its best practice to run on both nodes for same disk layouts on individual nodes.


5:46 - 13:10// what will be the default  isolation level of DB in Always on?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- for the primary server,its default read-committed. 
- on secondary replicas, it depends on the scenarios below.

#### Scenario1

    - on Secondary, if you DONT turn on for Read Workloads.
    - It is just the transfer of data from primary to secondary replicas.


#### Scenario2: 
    - on Secondary, if you turn on Read Workloads.
    - in this case, SQL server adds 14 byte over-head for each row on primary as well as SECONDARY.
    - for constant updated(not insert, delete) row, there will be performance issues.
    - uses SNAPSHOT isolation behind the scenes(ROW-VERSIONING HAPPENS). 

#### Scenario3: 
if primary has SNAPSHOT isolation level(row-version will be used) enabled, but secondary replicas NOT enabled for read workloads
- in this case, there will be slight performance at the primary since it adds 14 byte over-head & successive load from primary will be carried to secondary, but it does not maintain row-version in tempdb.

#### Scenario4: 
if primary has SNAPSHOT isolation level (row-version will be used) enabled & SECONDARY, but secondary replicas enabled for read workloads
- in this case, there will be row-version in tempdb along with 14 byte overhead.
- the secondary database also gets 14 byte overhead.
- The secondary database is also available for read access therefore, it also maintains row-version.


13:13 - 21:50 // how does statistics work on secondary replicas?
Can we create statistics on secondary replicas?
------------------------------------------------------------
- when we create an index on primary, the same get moved to secondary replicas. 
- In general, we cannot create statistics on secondary.
- for select queries with predicates, SQL Server will create column level statistics.
- if you turn on read workloads on secondary,it will create column level statistics inside the tempdb.

what happens when multi-subnet = true?

- there are chances for time-outs.
- the 2 IP addresses are located in the DNS server.
- DNS does not know which IP to connect to.
- by enabling to true, App will connect to IP addresses in DNS in parallel instead of serial which will let app know which is online IP & offline
