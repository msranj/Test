2:52 - 14:48 // talks about questions on backups
--------------------------------------------
Can we take backups on all replicas?

    Answer: only copy_only full backups allowed.

Can we take differential backups on replicas?

    Answer: No

On the primary server, Diff backups are NOT Able to take. Why?

    Answer: could be because 
    - If backups preference is given ‘SECONDARY ONLY’. 
    - Ask what is the error msg to interviewers. 
    
    - Ask questions like - are the database under AG or DAG?

    - For DAG, databases in secondary appears as primary(known as FORWARDER i.e the replicas in secondary will be seen as PRIMARY, so diff backups cannot be taken)

14:49 - 21:36 // what are the differences between AG & DAG
----------------------------------------------------
1. Resources 
-min AG, Resources are maintained in windows clustered level, 
- in DAG, resources are maintained at SQL server level.

2. Clusters
- AG has same failover clusters
- DAG has 2 different clusters.

Log records,

- In AG, Primary has to send log records to secondary replicas in the same region.
- In DAG, Secondary replicas in Different clusters appear as primary/FORWARDER. The primary in primary location will send log records to all replicas in its primary region & then to only FORWARDER in different cluster in another region, it will not send log records to other secondary replicas in different cluster in another region.

- Listener
    - AG has same Listener
    - DAG will have different listeners for each cluster.
    - So any issues in one cluster, app team should have a different connection string for the app connection.

- SQL versions
    - AG requires same SQL server versions
    - DAG can have different compatible versions in different clusters across regions.


33:20 - 45:53 // time-out error between primary & secondary replicas, how to troubleshoot?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Couple of reasons why it could happen

    - Network issues between primary & secondary replicas.
    - Any changes in firewall rules. 
    - VMware snapshots: causes the servers/nodes/replicas will freeze when VM level backup happens & nodes will lose connection due to idleness/no response.

46:33 - 52:30 // while performing DR Drill for TB size database with less time and you thought backups(copy-only full backups) are happening on secondary replicas. You are asked to restore database backups very quickly.

#### What kind of backups do you consider?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- On secondary replicas, we cant take differential backup since only copy-only backups are happening.
- We CANNOT go with normal backups as it will take a lot of time.
- We cannot go with copy-only full backup at secondary + Differential backup at primary. It will throw an error.
- We need to go with LOG BACKUPS on primary.

52:31 - 54:50 // ola hallengren backup scripts for AG to happen only on secondary. Should there be some tweaks for the automated backups to happen for ola scripts?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- We need to add COPY-ONLY to the script for modifying the backup preferences.
- As you know the backups would run based on backup preferences . Below is the script of Ola's which needs to be configured if you want to offload your backups. We will talk about the highlighted portion in detail down the line.

```
EXECUTE [dbo].[DatabaseBackup]
@Databases = 'USER_DATABASES',
@Directory = N'|\XXXXXXX\SQLBACKUP',
@BackupType = 'FULL',
@copyonly='Y'
```
- If we DON'T apply @copyonly='Y' Then backups happen on primary & secondary replicas.
