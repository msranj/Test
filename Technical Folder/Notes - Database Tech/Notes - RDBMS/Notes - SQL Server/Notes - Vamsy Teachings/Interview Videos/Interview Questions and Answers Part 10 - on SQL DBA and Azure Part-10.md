**36:41 - 43:27** // user is on SQL 2017(on-prem or Iaas), and migrated to SQL 2019, ran the workloads for a week & realized that performance is not good, so the user switched back from SQL 2019 to SQL 2017. What will be the reason to switch back to SQL 2017?

**0:00 - 25:53** // SQL agent unable to start
--------------------------------------
SQL agent fails with below error msg

    “
    The request failed or the service did not respond in a timely fashion.
    Consult the event log or other applicable error logs for details.

    ”


#### Troubleshooting Steps 
-------------------
    Go to error logs & inspect what is there in error logs.

    TLS in different versions will have different values. Both need to have same common algorithm/values.
    
    Engage wintel team if the values in registry needs to be updated.

    A 3rd party tools(IIS Crypto) available to make changes (not suitable for prod tasks, but for learning purpose in local system is fine)


Note:
-----
in SQL server 2022 version, we see the below msg
	“Starting up model_replicatedmaster”


**25:55 - 36:37** // how many files are there on tempdb for PaaS (Azure MI & Azure SQL)


### For Azure SQL

- In Azure SQL, we can see only Master DB under System Databases.
- No# of Tempdb files depend on the vCore config we chose for the database.(i.e Basic DTU or vCore Model)
- In query editor,execute the below query
    
        Select * from tempdb.sys.database_files

Check Tempdb file usage
https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuredbsupport/resolve-tempdb-related-errors-in-azure-sql-database/3597944
```
SELECT [Source] = 'database_files', [TEMPDB_max_size_MB] = SUM(max_size) * 8 / 1027.0, [TEMPDB_current_size_MB] = SUM(size) * 8 / 1027.0, [FileCount] = COUNT(FILE_ID) FROM tempdb.sys.database_files WHERE type = 0 --ROWS
```
- Also depends on vCore configuration what we selected.

### For Azure MI

- Default is 12 Tempdb db files & 1 log file

**36:41 - 43:27** // user is on SQL 2017(on-prem or Iaas), and migrated to SQL 2019, ran the workloads for a week & realized that performance is not good, so the user switched back from SQL 2019 to SQL 2017. What will be the reason to switch back to SQL 2017?

- The issue could be due to compatibility.
- In SQL 2019, we have batch mode on row-store operation similar to that of Columnstore indexes.


        what is batch mode - in exec plans

        - From 2012, we have columnstore indexes. We cannot create clustered indexes, so only Non-clustered column store indexes, even then the entire table will become READ-ONLY.
        
        - On the columnstore index,index function is different from traditional indexes. I.e. Traditional indexes will be in B-Tree index format, execution goes Row-by-Row manner from the top level -> Intermediate-Level ->leaf node level.
        
        - For Columnstore indexes, index architecture is completely different. Here there is a BATCH mode for execution plans.


**43:28 - 1:03:04** // what is a proxy account in SQL server?

- Whenever Non-System Admins need to Run Non-TSQL job steps, then they need Proxy accounts.
- Steps to create proxy

    1. Create credential
    2. Go to proxies -> select appropriate component-> right click & select “New Proxy” -> fill with proxy & principle details(select the login that needs proxy account).
