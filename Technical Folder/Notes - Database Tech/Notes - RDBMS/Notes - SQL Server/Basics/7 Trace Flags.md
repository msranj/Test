https://mohammaddarab.com/how-to-stop-delete-sql-server-trace/

Trace flag in SQL server sets the specific characteristic of the server. It works as an "IF" condition for the SQL Server. The most common trace flags used with SQL Server are:


The trace id is the id you find by doing a select * from sys.traces

The status is either a 0, 1 or 2:

	- 0 stops the trace, 
	- 1 starts the trace, 
	- 2 closes the specified trace and deletes its definition from the server. 

## How to delete a trace flag

Step1: find the trace id from : select * from sys.traces.

Step2: stop the trace by executing sp_trace_setstatus trace_id, 0 .
