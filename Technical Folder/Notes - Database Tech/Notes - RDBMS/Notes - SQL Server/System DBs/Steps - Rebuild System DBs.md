# Rebuild System databases (Master/MSDB/Model/tempdb (if no backups ))

### Pre-requisites: 

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/rebuild-system-databases?view=sql-server-ver15

		1) make a note of all configurations, packages/pacthes applied on instances

		2) copy the template files of all master, msdb, model db as its reuquired during the rebuild process. 
		if not, use repair feature of setup & manually copy to SQL Server template directory.

		3) if replciation is configured, take backups of distributor db

		4) backup master, msdb, model dbs

		5) make a note of all data/log file locations of all master, model,msdb as the location of these files will be 
		in default location after rebuild.
	
		Doing otherwise might result in undefined SQL Server instance behavior, with inconsistent feature support, and is not guaranteed to be viable.
		
		Rebuild process:
		>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
		
        on stand alone server, its normal procedure.
		
        on clustered instances, perform the activities on active node, its resources must be taken offline first.
		
		Rebuild Master/MSDB,Model/System db in case of

			> corruption in master/system dbs
			> modify the server level collation.
		
		Note: after rebuild on existing master/msdb/model db & its associated packages/jobs etc will be lost.


## Steps to Rebuild System Databases (Model, MSDB,Tempdb)
			NOTE: Rebuild for RESOURCE DB is separate procedure
			
			1) Insert the SQL Server installation media into the disk drive, or, from a command prompt, change directories to the location of the setup.exe file on the local server. The default location on the server is C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Setup Bootstrap\SQLServer2016.
			
			2) From a command prompt window, enter the following command. Square brackets are used to indicate optional parameters. Do not enter the brackets. 
			cmd>> Setup /QUIET /ACTION=REBUILDDATABASE /INSTANCENAME=InstanceName /SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS=accounts [ /SAPWD= StrongPassword ] [ /SQLCOLLATION=CollationName]
			
			3) When Setup has completed rebuilding the system databases, it returns to the command prompt with no messages. Examine the Summary.txt log file to verify that the process completed successfully. 
			This file is located at C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Setup Bootstrap\Logs.
			
		
			Post-Rebuild Tasks

				After rebuilding the database you may need to perform the following additional tasks:
				
				1) Restore your most recent full backups of the master, model, and msdb databases. For more information
				
                2) If the instance of SQL Server is configured as a replication Distributor, you must restore the distribution database.
				
                3) if location change required for system dbs, Move the system databases to the locations you recorded previously.
			
					
## Rebuild: Resource Database
		
				The following procedure rebuilds the resource system database. When you rebuild the resource database, all hot fixes are lost, 
				and therefore must be reapplied.
				
				To rebuild the Resource system database:
				>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
					1) Launch the SQL Server Setup program (setup.exe) from the distribution media.
					2) In left navigation area, click Maintenance, and then click Repair.
					3) Setup support rule and file routines run to ensure that your system has prerequisites installed and that the computer passes Setup  
					     validation rules. Click OK or Install to continue.
					4) On the Select Instance page, select the instance to repair, and then click Next.
					5) The repair rules will run to validate the operation. To continue, click Next.
					6) From the Ready to Repair page, click Repair. The Complete page indicates that the operation is finished.

			
## Rebuild: MSDB Database (if no backups)
			
			Create a New msdb Database
			
				If the msdb database is damaged and you do not have a backup of the msdb database, you can create a new msdb by using the instmsdb script. by rebuilding msdb, all jobs, packages, reports, alerts, notifications will be lost.
			
				1)Stop all services connecting to the Database Engine, including SQL Server Agent, SSRS, SSIS, and all applications using SQL Server as data store.
				2)Start SQL Server from the command line using the command: NET START MSSQLSERVER /T3608
				3) In another command line window, detach the msdb database by executing the 
				following command, replacing <servername> with the instance of SQL Server: 
					CMD>> SQLCMD -E -S<servername> -dmaster -Q"EXEC sp_detach_db msdb"
				4) Using the Windows Explorer, rename the msdb database files. By default these are in the DATA sub-folder for the SQL Server instance.
				5) Using SQL Server Configuration Manager, stop and restart the Database Engine service normally.
				6) In a command line window, connect to SQL Server and execute the 
					cmd: SQLCMD -E -S<servername> -i"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Install\instmsdb.sql" -o"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Install\instmsdb.out"
				Replace <servername> with the instance of the Database Engine. Use the file system path of the instance of SQL Server.
				7) Using the Windows Notepad, open the instmsdb.out file and check the output for any errors.
				8) Re-apply any hotfix installed on the instance.
				9) Recreate the user content stored in the msdb database, such as jobs, alert, etc.
				10) Backup the msdb database.

## Rebuild: Tempdb
		
If the tempdb database is damaged and the database engine fails to start, you can rebuild tempdb without the need to rebuild all system databases.

	1) Rename the current tempdb.mdf and templog.ldf files, if not missing.

	2) Start SQL Server from a Command Prompt by using the following command.
		cmd>> sqlservr -c -f -T3608 -T4022 -s <instance> -mSQLCMD (for named instance use MSSQL$<instance_name>)
				Note : Make sure that the command prompt window remains open after the SQL Server starts. Closing the command prompt window will terminate the process.

	3) Connect to the server by using sqlcmd, and then use the following stored procedure to reset the status of the tempdb database.
		sqlcmd> exec master..sp_resetstatus tempdb
	
    4) Shut down the server by pressing CTRL+C in the command prompt window
	
    5) Restart the SQL Server service. This creates a new set of tempdb database files, and recovers the tempdb database.
