## Moving system db files to new location.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/move-system-databases?view=sql-server-ver15

Steps for moving master & resource db are different. For rest of system dbs the procedure is same.

### Steps for: Moving Model db files to new locations
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

			Step1) For each Model DB file to be moved, run the following statement.
				Cmd>> ALTER DATABASE <database_name>
			      MODIFY FILE ( NAME = logical_name , FILENAME = 'new_path\os_file_name' )

			Step2) stop the SQL services

			Step3) move the db files to new location.

			Step4) restart the SQL services and perfrom validation if new file path has been updated.
				SELECT name, physical_name AS CurrentLocation, state_desc FROM sys.master_files WHERE database_id = DB_ID(N'<database_name>'); 
				
### Steps for: Moving MSDB db files to new locations
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

			Step1) For each Model DB file to be moved, run the following statement.
				Cmd>> ALTER DATABASE <database_name>
			      MODIFY FILE ( NAME = logical_name , FILENAME = 'new_path\os_file_name' )

			Step2) stop the SQL services

			Step3) move the db files to new location.

			Step4) restart the SQL services and perfrom validation if new file path has been updated.
				SELECT name, physical_name AS CurrentLocation, state_desc FROM sys.master_files WHERE database_id = DB_ID(N'<database_name>'); 
				
				If the msdb database is moved and the instance of SQL Server is configured for Database Mail, complete these additional steps.
				Verify that Service Broker is enabled for the msdb database by running the following query.
		
				SELECT is_broker_enabled FROM sys.databases WHERE name = N'msdb';  
				
		
### Steps for: Moving Tempdb db files to new locations
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
			Step1)  run the following statement.
				Cmd>> 
				ALTER DATABASE <database_name>
			      MODIFY FILE ( NAME = tempdev , FILENAME = 'new_path\xyz.mdf' )
				go
				ALTER DATABASE <database_name>
			      MODIFY FILE ( NAME = templog, FILENAME = 'new_path\xyz.ldf' )

			Step2) stop the SQL services

			Step3) move the db files to new location.

			Step4) restart the SQL services and perfrom validation if new file path has been updated.
				SELECT name, physical_name AS CurrentLocation, state_desc FROM sys.master_files WHERE database_id = DB_ID(N'<database_name>'); 
				
		
### Steps for: Moving master db files to new locations
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

			Step1) go to SQL Server configuration manager

			Step2) navigate to "startup parameters"
				• for master data file, navigate to data file i.e. -d<new master file path>\master.mdf & press update (-d<without space, new file path>)
				• for master log file, navigate to data file i.e. -l<new master file path>\master.ldf & press update (-l<without space, new file path>)
				• for master error log file, navigate to data file i.e. -e<new master file path>\master.mdf & press update (-e<without space, new file path>)
			- for specific file, browse & update the path and save. when done press OK.

			Step3) now, stop the SQL Services & physically change/update the master file to new location.

			Step4) start the sql services. now master files will be in new location.
			 
			new: -dD:\Installation of Softwares\SQL Server - DB files\master.mdf
			old: -dD:\Installation of Softwares\SQL Server - Dev Edition\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\master.mdf

			Step5) Verify the db files if in new location
				SELECT name, physical_name AS CurrentLocation, state_desc 
				FROM sys.master_files 
				WHERE database_id = DB_ID('master'); 
				GO 
				
				
### Steps for: Moving Resource db files to new locations
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
			▪ The database cannot be moved. Only copy of the files can be taken
